## This is my version of monopoly - I create this project to pass Object-oriented programming subject. I code it in python using pygame.

To start this game you need install pygame and after this run a game_loop.py file

# Rules of the game:
* every turn player must roll the dice
* if the player has two identical dice values, he have additional turn
* if player has two identical dice values three turn in row he go to prison
* if player go to prison, he have three option - can wait two turn, paid 500k or use "get out of jail" cart
* player can buy cell when stand on free cell
* player can buy house/hotel when have all cart from the same section
* if in any cell from section player have house/hotel he can't sell any cell from this section
* when some player stand on other player cell must paid him
* if cell owner is in prison, player who stand in his cell don't pay him
* games end when only one player is not bancrupt.
