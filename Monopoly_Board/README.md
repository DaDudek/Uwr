## This is my version of monopoly - I create this project to pass Object-oriented programming subject. I code it in python using pygame.

To start this game you need install pygame and after this run a game_loop.py file

# Rules of the game:
* every turn player must roll the dice
* if player rolls two identical dices, they get an additional turn
* if player gets two identical dices three turns in a row they go to prison
* if player goes to prison, they have three options - wait two turns, pay 500k or use "get out of jail" card
* player can buy cell when they stand on free cell
* player can buy house/hotel when they have all cards from the same section
* if player has house/hotel on a cell, he can't sell any cells from this section
* when some player stands on other player’s cell, they must pay them
* if cell owner is in prison, player who stand on his cell doesn't need to pay them
* games end when there’s only one player not bancrupt
