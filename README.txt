This is my version of monopoly - I create this project to pass Object-oriented programming. I code it in python using pygame.

Rules of the game:
- every turn player must roll the dice
- if the player has two identical dice values, he have additional turn
- if player has two identical dice values three turn in row he go to prison
- if player go to prison, he have three option - can wait two turn, paid 500k or use "get out of jail" cart
- player can buy cell when stand on free cell
- player can buy house/hotel when have all cart from the same section
- if in any cell from section player have house/hotel he can't sell any cell from this section
- when some player stand on other player cell must paid him
- if cell owner is in prison, player who stand in his cell don't pay him
- games end when only one player is not bancrupt.
